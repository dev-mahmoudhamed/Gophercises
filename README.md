# 🇵🇸 Gophercises Solutions by Mahmoud Hamed

This repository contains my solutions for the **[Gophercises](https://courses.calhoun.io/courses/cor_gophercises)** course by Jon Calhoun.  
I'm using this project to practice Go by solving real, hands-on exercises that cover topics like file I/O, interfaces, concurrency, and web development.

## 📚 About the Course

**Gophercises** is a series of coding exercises designed to help Go developers strengthen their skills by building small, practical projects.  
Each exercise focuses on a particular concept — from reading CSV files and building CLI tools, to working with web servers and databases.
